       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> 4-6 Eggs</li>
        <li><b>Mlik:</b> 4-6 tablespoon of Milk(1 tablespoon of milk for every egg)</li>
        <li><b>Spices:</b> Salt and Pepper by your taste.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh herbs:</b> This is optional but chop fresh parsley and any other herbs u want.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Break some eggs: </b>Crack eggs on a flat surface (helps ensure shells stay out of the mix) into a bowl that's deep enough for some serious whisking.</li>
        <li><b>Add liquid: </b>If you wish, you can thin the scrambled egg mix with milk, cream, lemon juice, or even a little water. This optional step makes gently cooked scrambled eggs tender, almost custardy. Add up to 1 tablespoon of liquid per egg. Whisk thoroughly. Using a fork to whisk is perfectly fine; just be sure to whisk the eggs until all of the yolks and whites are thoroughly mixed together.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the skillet: </b>To make scrambled eggs on the stove, melt a teaspoon of butter or olive oil — or a combination of both — in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Butter and oil add rich flavor to the eggs and help prevent sticking, but you can also use cooking spray.</li>
        <li><b>Add the eggs and stir: </b>When the butter starts to bubble, or a drop of water added to the pan sizzles, slowly pour in the egg mixture. Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and as soon as the eggs begin to "set" or form a slightly solid base (a minute or two), gently stir with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li><b>Add more flavor: </b>As soft curds begin to form, add minced herbs, shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, chopped scallions, sautéed mushrooms, chopped tomato, or anything else you like. Gently fold those ingredients into the eggs. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>The big finish: </b>Gently scrap the bottom of the pan, turning the eggs until almost all of the egg mixture has cooked through but there are still a few wet areas. Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until the eggs finish cooking using only the residual heat from the pan. This helps prevent the eggs from overcooking. Serve immediately, ideally on plates that have been warmed in the oven. Your perfect scrambled eggs are ready to be tucked into a breakfast burrito, placed onto toast or an English muffin, or on top of your favorite green salad for a French-inspired brunch dish.</li>
